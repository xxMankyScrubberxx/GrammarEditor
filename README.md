# GrammarEditor

Created as part of a collaborative effort with Butterweich Agency.
The editor is to be compatible on iOS, Android and Windows.
Reads in grammar data from a JSON output of a REST API

Very early beginnings if an editor to get away from
the use of spreadsheets to edit data.

Outputs are not yet determined, but changes can
be output for the entire dataset or by individual
record, which can be uploaded somewhere or saved
to a database.

Included in a web project are basic APIs for
returning data as JSON for phone numbers email
addresses and generated messages. HTML examples that
demonstrate how to use the APIs, which can be used
for new coder education.
